# One Day the World Ended Roleplaying Game

The world has ended and you find yourself an unfamiliar place, thrust together with other strangers. You all know that this isn’t the world you remember, but no one else around you agrees. Can you piece together what happened to the world you knew and return to the familiar, or does this new world appeal to you and you’d rather stay?

“One day the World ended” (ODTWE) is rule-light roleplay game designed for one shot sessions, with a setting, characters and goals that change every time. It is designed to explore alternative world ideas and settings, and there is no real “aim” or “win condition”, simply to have fun as seriously, or as jovially as you wish.

There are two variants to the game.

One is run with a storyteller (or games master, or keeper, or all knowing overlord), where there is something of a mystery to attempt to unravel. For more on that variant, jump right to the outline for a "[storyteller led game](#storyteller-led-game)".

The other is a collaborative storytelling game played over two rounds, where you work the generated setting and characters into a combined narrative, but no one person is in charge of the world. For more on that variant, jump right to the outline for a "[player led game](#player-led-game)".

No matter which variant you play, you still need to generate characters and a world. You can do this from your imagination, or use [the ODTWE app](/app).

## Storyteller led game

A storyteller led game is more unstructured, and is mostly up to the storyteller and players. A Storyteller led game involves (basic) mechanics, character feature, a [reason the world ended](#reason), and a [new world setting](#setting). But how you decide to play with these is largely up to you. Extra ideas and advice are throughout the rest of the rules, and generally I conceived the game as kind of a "what happened?" mystery in a strange and surreal world.

## Player led game

The player led game consists of two rounds. In each round players take it in turns to tell their story. A game is designed to be fun, so other players are encouraged to add flavour and interjections to the story as much as suits the group and their play style. However players are not able to derail, or contradict another players story unless they use an [item](#items) or [feature](#features).

### Round one - the reason

In the first round each player takes it in turns to tell their story of [the reason](#reason) the world ended. The elements of the reason are a shared world the players are all a part of, but the players don't necessarily need to know each other or to have experienced the reason together.

### Round two - the new world

In the second round each player takes it in turns to tell their story of the new [world](#setting) they find themselves thrust into. In this round the players find themselves together with their knowledge of each other continued from the first round.

## Creating a character

Each player needs a character for the story.

### Statistics

There are three statistics to form your character and are a means to create challenges and risk throughout a game, not for attempting to create the “best” character.

- **Brains**: How smart or wise
- **Braun**: How strong or agile
- **Charisma**: How charming or influential

For each ability, roll a D6, you then have three extra points to distribute among the statistics as you wish. You can also use [the ODTWE app](/app) to generate these for you.

#### Player led game

If playing the player led variant, I recommend you still generate these statistics to give your character shape, but they perform no mechanical function.

#### Storyteller led game

When your story teller asks for a check, roll a D6 plus or minus a value they give you to set the difficulty, and if you roll equal to or under your statistic value you are successful. If you roll higher, you fail. What that means is determined by the storyteller, and the test, or story.

### Background

Every character receives a background that (loosely) defines their character. Again, [use the app](/app) to generate this, and I’d recommend you take the first generated (unless it’s complete nonsense), or you run the risk of players trying to create their “perfect” character, which is not what ODTWE is about.

### Features

Every character also receives 3 random features that they can use once per scenario.

#### Player led game

Typically in a player led game, the player currently telling the story leads the narrative. A feature is a way that other players can change another players narrative for the positive or negative.

#### Storyteller led game

These are not designed to help you win or do better in a scenario, but rather push a storyline aspect forward. When you use them, tell your story teller how it affects the scenario and what you hope to accomplish by using it. Your story tellers might ask for a related dice roll to add risk or chance, or they might tell you the idea is ludicrous, overpowered, or genius. It is up to them, the players, and the art of good storytelling.

### Items

Every character also receives 3 items that they can use once per scenario.

There are two options for giving characters items, depending how you want to play the game. You can [use the ODTWE app](/app) to generate 3 random items each character has, or you can let each player define the three items they posses. It depends if you want to have very normal characters thrust into a strange scenario completely unprepared, or if you want to have complete randomness.

#### Player led game

Typically in a player led game, the player currently telling the story leads the narrative. An item is a way that other players can change another players narrative for the positive or negative.

#### Storyteller led game

Players can use these items in as many inventive ways as they want to drive the narrative. They can also lend them to other players if they might need them during their narrative. However, the storytellers' decision on wether this requires a check, and the final outcome is final.

## Creating a World

Each session of ODTWE should be different from the last, with different characters, a different setting, and a different reason for the story.

### Setting

Generate a random world setting by [using the ODTWE app](/app). The algorithm for generating these is improving all the time, but will output ideas that make no sense, are too hard for you or your players, or don’t suit you. That’s fine, keep generating a setting until you’re happy with the result.

If you’re interested you can even contribute to the code or the content behind the code, in fact, I encourage it! Find out more.

#### Player led game

The setting forms round two of the player led game. Players take in turns to describe an aspect of the world, or their daily life in it. How does it feel to live in this new world? What changes did people adapt or not adapt to?

#### Storyteller led game

How you decide to employ this setting is up to you. Some lend themselves to a loose framework to play within, while some define a very concrete character on the setting. Some enable flexibility in how you interpret them, while others are restrictive, and complex to play. Again, it’s up to you, and how you want to play the game.

### Reason

The reason for the end of the world gives a loose aim and structure to the game, but again it’s open for any interpretation you want to take with it. You generate a set of random keywords that give the reason for the end of the world by using the ODTWE app, again, the same caveats as the setting apply, keep going until you generate a result you are happy with and contributions are always welcome.

The result gives you a handful of components to the reason the world ended, including:

- Who triggered it
- How they triggered it
- Where they triggered it
- Why they triggered it
- When they triggered it
- How they felt when they triggered it

_Due to the nature of the random text generation, the reason may not contain all of these values, add any that are missing, or important to you_.

#### Player led game

The reason forms round one of the player led game. Players take in turns to describe an aspect of the reason the world ended. Did they see how it happened, did they know the person? Where they simply living their lives as they witnessed the world around them collapsing?

#### Storyteller led game

If there’s a person involved, then they are also in this new world with the players. Maybe they are aware that they are in a strange place, and what they did, maybe not. Use elements of the reason to entice players along the story in an attempt to solve the “mystery”. How they resolve this is up to you, maybe it’s tracking down this person and confronting them with what they’ve done. Maybe it’s just a case of assembling a series of the facts. When resolved (<!-- TODO: this needs more details -->) through some mechanism, or method that is up to you, offer the players an option, which option they choose is individual:

- They can now return home to the world they know and continue their lives. In which case for the next session of ODTWE they start With a new character.
- They can continue to a new setting and reason with the same character, plus a new skill gained through the scenario (<!-- TODO: connect some how -->).

## Submit your content

I already mentioned several ways you can contribute to content (and code) behind the world generation, but don’t stop there! ODTWE was always designed to be a growing series of interconnected stories that explore utopias, dystopias, and everything in between. Add any other ideas you have, unforgettable characters or scenarios you generated that could become something broader. Maybe record your games and upload them somewhere, or turn a session into notes or a story and add that. Interact and connect other player’s ideas, and feel free to take settings, characters, or the resulting stories into new territories.
