# Scenario - Democracy overdose

## Who and how

A world leader who was indescribably good looking and charming sealed themselves in an airport as their fortress and forced their population to constantly vote on every small issue, 

### More detail

Depending on the level of comedy or darkness you want in the session, here are some suggestions to expand this further.

-   The votes can be on comically ridiculous things, dark things, or slowly slide from one extreme to other.
-   Do the votes themselves cause the end of the world, or is it the chaos caused by people having no time for anything else?
-   Do the people vote to end the world?
-   How does the leader gain power in the first place?

## World

The new world is full of creatures that have evolved too much, as with other ODTWE scenarios, you can interpret this in different ways. Here’s some ideas:

-   Every creature is evolved to the point of being really good at just one thing, but terrible at everything else.
-   Every creature has evolved into one ultimate creature.
-   The characters are out of place in this new world and treated as objects of amusement, study, or as a threat.

## Storyline suggestions

If you’re struggling to piece together an actual session outline from the ideas above, here’s some ideas to get you started, fill in the details on timelines, characters and events as required.

### Careful what you wish for

After a string of despotic dictators, a young, charismatic leader convinces the people of a small to medium sized nation to vote for them on a policy of extreme democracy. Their first act is to ask the people what they want to vote for, and the response is "everything". This begins with large, important matters, such as domestic and foreign policy, but rapidly becomes ridiculous, with votes for what toilet paper the civil service should buy, and what colour walls should be painted. The constant voting cripples the nation, leading to economic meltdown, and frustration so extreme the people vote to end the world to alleviate the agony out of shear frustration.

### A dark desire

After a string of despotic dictators, a young, charismatic leader convinces the people of a small to medium sized nation to vote for them on a policy of extreme democracy. Their first act is to ask the people what they want to vote for, and the response is "everything". Sadly this leads to the inevitable ads people vote to destroy people that have annoyed them, ranging from their neighbours, to entire countries. This leads to a global arms race, and the end of the world.
