# Scenario - Idle hands

## Who and how

A bored programmer created a malicious program that caused the end of the world.
 
### More detail

Depending on the level of comedy or darkness you want in the session, here are some suggestions to expand this further.

- The program infiltrated nuclear facilities around the world and caused a nuclear catastrophe.
- The end of the world happened in the future, and the program infected robot soldiers to wipe out humanity
- The program was a harmless meme that somehow found it’s way to dark forces inhabiting dark recesses of the internet who took it literally.
- The code contained biblical / satanical rites that triggered the end of days

## World

Everything runs backwards, as with other ODTWE scenarios, you can interpret this in different ways. Here’s some ideas:

- Time runs backwards, i.e. people age in reverse from old to young, they devolve, history undoes itself etc.
- People run backwards. They walk and speak backwards, but time moves forward.
- People, places, animals and things are all inside out.

## Storyline suggestions

If you’re struggling to piece together an actual session outline from the ideas above, here’s some ideas to get you started, fill in the details on timelines, characters and events as required.

### Post apocalyptic rewind

A bored programmer who lurks on seedy online forums takes part in a series of coding dares with each participant upping the dares in scale as they progress. The final culmination of this is the programmer embarking on a dare to end all dares. They create an application that spreads itself among all nuclear facilities (plants, weapons, refineries) so quickly, security are powerless to stop it before it creates a global nuclear catastrophe as missiles are launched, waste dumped, and plants explode.

Perhaps one of the players was an active or lurking member of this forum, or worked in security at a facility. Maybe clues are left behind by other members for others to find them. Either way, somehow the players find out what happened, and attempt to find the programmer. Perhaps they try to encourage them to reverse the program (the world runs backwards after all), or bring them to justice, or convince such a dastardly talent to join their party for evil ends.

### When are we?

The players awake surrounded by people they don’t understand. What language are they speaking? It seems strangely familiar, unyet not at all. Slowly through a series of clues from the storyteller the players piece together the world they are in, and hear of the “great wizard” who claims to have created the world, and as they is the only one who can control the strange machines that run the world, the people believe them. The Wizard is callous, unfriendly, and evil, but they, and their small inner circle of cackling underlings (perhaps fellow nerds from the old world) wield power over the people through the infernal machines.

Through either investigation, conversation, or intrusive they players should be made to realise that this “great wizard” also talks (and reads and writes) just like them. Maybe this is the programmer, ruling a world they created. Do the players expose their identity, topple them, or persuade the programmer to give the world a chance, and do the right thing.
